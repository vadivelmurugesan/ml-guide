# ML Guide

A collection of Jupyter notebooks to understand AI/ML concepts in a simple way.

## Notebooks

### 1. Foundational Models vs Cognitive Models
This notebook demonstrates the differences between Foundational Models (like GPT-2) and Cognitive Models (logic-based decision-making).

#### Foundational Model using GPT-2
- Uses the GPT-2 model from the `transformers` library to generate text based on a given prompt.
- Example prompt: "Artificial intelligence is changing the world because..."
- Demonstrates how foundational models can generate coherent text based on learned patterns.

#### Simple Cognitive Model
- Implements a logic-based decision-making model.
- Example scenario: Deciding whether to eat at home, order food, or buy food based on memory and goals.
- Demonstrates how cognitive models use explicit rules to make decisions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Libraries: `transformers`, `torch`

## Installation
To install the required libraries, run:
```bash
pip install transformers torch
```
